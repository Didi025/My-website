          <h3>Photo Editing</h3>
          <p>Before this I felt I was just "book smart" with no substantial talent and by God's grace I picked this up during COVID-19 lockdown.I am not a professional yet but I have the passion and determination to get there.</p>

          <h3>Baking</h3>
          <p>This came as a suprise to me because I never liked anything to do with the kitchen.<em>My mum would always say <strong>"cooking is a form of art"</strong> and my usually reply would be <strong>"it is an act of survival"</strong></em>.But after high school my aunt taught me and I loved it. The COVID-19 lockdown period once again played a key role in my improvement because I had time for some courses and more practice. </p>
